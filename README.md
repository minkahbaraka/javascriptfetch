# Reliability Interviews
## Why are We Hiring and Why This Process?
Being a professional is hard. Not only do you need to be an expert in your field but you then need to worry about how you communicate, manage your time, store and share information, keep your data secure, make your tooling reliable, and a million other details. Filevine dreams of a day when all of these details are taken care of so that professionals can get back to focusing on what they love. 

We are building our team because we recognize that to make good on that dream we need the help of amazingly talented people like you. 

The intent of this interview process is to help both you and Filevine gain confidence that we are a good fit for each other and that establishing a working relationship will be of lasting benefit to everyone. 

## The Process 
The overall process we follow is detailed below. We are trying to optimize for quick decision making so that no one is waiting too long before they know the state of the process. Either side can end the process at any phase but we aim to complete the whole process in less than 2 weeks. 

**Initial Screening** - By this point one of our recruiters has called you and decided you might be good fit for one of our open position. 

**First Interview** - This interview will be with the hiring manager and occasionally other team members they choose to invite. These last a total of 60 minutes. 
- Introductions to each other and to the role - 10 minutes
- Our DevOps philosophy - 10 minutes
- An opportunity for you to ask questions - 10 minutes 

**SRE Challenge Take Home Assignment** - Details below - 30 minutes 

**Wider Team Interview** - This interview will be with your hiring manager, the team lead of your perspective team, a Sr. SRE, and occasionally individuals from other parts of Filevine - This interview is an opportunity for the wider team to ask ad hoc questions to evaluate if they think you will be a good addition to the team, and is generally far more stressful than the first - 60 minutes 

**Ad hoc interviews** (Depends On Circumstances) - It is sometimes necessary to have extra interviews with team members who couldn't be present during one of the previous rounds 

**The Final Decision** - We try to make deliberations as short as possible and communicate to you in a timely manner if we will make an offer for you to join us or not
